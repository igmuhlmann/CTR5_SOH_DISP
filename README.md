# CTR SNMP Monitoring Tool  

A Linux/Bash tool to periodically generate an SOH query file for Nanometrics Centaur Dataloggers.
It queries system state commands (uname -a, df, time, uptime) and queries SNMP OIDs from a Nanometrics Centaur, decode selected values (including firmware hex fields), track changes over time, and write timestamped output to a file (which then can be transfered via SCP to a local computer).
While the Shell Script is for installing on the system, there is a power Shell version that runs locally on Windows PC in a subfolder (and only queries SNMMP).

## Features

- Reads OID list from a CSV file  
- Performs periodic `snmpget` queries  
- Handles Centaur-specific OIDs and maps numeric states to human-readable text  
- Special decoding of the firmware version (hex → ASCII)  
- Maintains a persistent state file to detect changes between loops  
- Adds an ISO-8601 timestamp every time a value changes  
- Generates a header with system information  
- Writes all output into a single text file (`CTR_SNMP_Output.txt`)

## Project Structure

├── monitor_snmp.sh # Main script\
├── CTR_SNMP_OID.csv # CSV containing Variable,OID\
├── CTR_SNMP_Output.txt # Output generated by the script\
└── .snmp_state # Auto-generated change-tracking file

## Requirements
The script requires:

- **bash 4+**  
- **net-snmp** (`snmpget`)
- **coreutils** (`base64`, `date`)  
- **xxd** (usually part of `vim-common`)  
All of these are installed on the system already

## Installation
